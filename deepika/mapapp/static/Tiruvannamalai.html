Tiruvannamalai stands tall, sacred and serene, beneath the gaze of Arunachaleshwar. I've walked its paths just twice, yet its spirit lingers like a quiet chant in my heart. But for my sister, it's a canvas of countless memories, painted with devotion and joy. She returned often, drawn by something deeper than prayer — a rhythm only she understood. In its shadow, laughter bloomed, and moments were shared that words dare not name. Her happiness echoed through its streets — and that joy made it my favorite place too.
