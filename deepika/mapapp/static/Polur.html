Polur is more than just a town to me — it's where my journey truly began. From 6th to 12th standard, I walked its streets, studied in its classrooms, and grew with its rhythm. Every corner holds a memory, every breeze whispers a moment I once lived. It's the place where many of my “firsts” happened — my first friends, my first dreams, my first victories. No matter where life takes me, Polur remains etched in my heart like a timeless melody. I can never forget this town — it shaped me, inspired me, and gave me roots to fly.
